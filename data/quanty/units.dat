R_K    25812.807 ohm    # Measurement of the ohm also presents difficulties.
                        #   The old approach involved maintaining resistances
                        #   that were subject to drift.  The new standard is
                        #   based on the Hall effect.  When a current carrying
                        #   ribbon is placed in a magnetic field, a potential
                        #   difference develops across the ribbon.  The ratio
                        #   of the potential difference to the current is
                        #   called the Hall resistance.  Klaus von Klitzing
                        #   discovered in 1980 that the Hall resistance varies
                        #   in discrete jumps when the magnetic field is very
                        #   large and the temperature very low.  This enables
                        #   accurate realization of the resistance h/e^2 in the
                        #   lab.  The value given here is the officially

# Gaussian system: electromagnetic units derived from statampere.

# Note that the Gaussian units are often used in such a way that Coulomb's law
# has the form F= q1 * q2 / r^2.  The constant 1|4*pi*epsilon_zero is incorporated
# into the units.  From this, we can get the relation force=charge^2/dist^2.
# This means that the simplification esu^2 = dyne cm^2 can be used to simplify
# units in the Gaussian system, with the curious result that capacitance can be
# measured in cm, resistance in sec/cm, and inductance in sec^2/cm.  These

## The metric paper sizes are defined so that if a sheet is cut in half
## along the short direction, the result is two sheets which are
## similar to the original sheet.  This means that for any metric size,
## the long side is close to sqrt(2) times the length of the short
## side.  Each series of sizes is generated by repeated cuts in half, 
## with the values rounded down to the nearest millimeter.

# In the USA, a collection of crazy historical paper measures are used.  Paper
# is measured as a weight of a ream of that particular type of paper.  This is
# sometimes called the "substance" or "basis" (as in "substance 20" paper).
# The standard sheet size or "basis size" varies depending on the type of
# paper.  As a result, 20 pound bond paper and 50 pound text paper are actually
# about the same weight.  The different sheet sizes were historically the most
# convenient for printing or folding in the different applications.  These
# different basis weights are standards maintained by American Society for
# Testing Materials (ASTM) and the American Forest and Paper Association
# (AF&PA).

# In vacuum science and some other applications, gas flow is measured
# as the product of volumetric flow and pressure.  This is useful
# because it makes it easy to compare with the flow at standard
# pressure (one atmosphere).  It also directly relates to the number
# of gas molecules per unit time, and hence to the mass flow if the
# molecular mass is known.

# Wire gauge: this area is a nightmare with huge charts of wire gauge diameters
# that usually have no clear origin.  There are at least 5 competing wire gauge
# systems to add to the confusion.


# The use of wire gauge is related to the manufacturing method: a metal rod is
# heated and drawn through a hole.  The size change can't be too big.  To get
# smaller wires, the process is repeated with a series of smaller holes.  

# American Wire Gauge (AWG) or Brown & Sharpe Gauge appears to be the most
# important gauge. ASTM B-258 specifies that this gauge is based on geometric
# interpolation between gauge 0000, which is 0.46 inches exactly, and gauge 36
# which is 0.005 inches exactly.  Therefore, the diameter in inches of a wire
# is given by the formula 1|200 92^((36-g)/39).  Note that 92^(1/39) is close
# to 2^(1/6), so diameter is approximately halved for every 6 gauges.  For the
# repeated zero values, use negative numbers in the formula.  The same document
# also specifies rounding rules which seem to be ignored by makers of tables.
# Gauges up to 44 are to be specified with up to 4 significant figures, but no
# closer than 0.0001 inch.  Gauges from 44 to 56 are to be rounded to the
# nearest 0.00001 inch.  The table below gives 4 significant figures for all
# gauges.
#
# In addition to being used to measure wire thickness, this gauge is used to
# measure the thickness of sheets of aluminum, copper, and most metals other
# than steel, iron and zinc.

# .0625 inch thick and 40 ounces per square foot (the original standard was
# based on wrought iron at .2778 pounds per cubic inch; steel has almost
# entirely superseded wrought iron for sheet use, at .2833 pounds per cubic
# inch). Smaller numbers refer to greater thickness. There is no formula for
# converting gage to thickness or weight.
# 
# It's rather unclear from the passage above whether the plate gauge values are
# therefore wrong if steel is being used.  Reference [15] states that steel is
# in fact measured using this gauge (under the name Manufacturers' Standard
# Gauge) with a density of 501.84 lb/ft3 = 0.2904 lb/in3 used for steel.
# But this doesn't seem to be the correct density of steel (.2833 lb/in3 is
# closer), and nobody else lists these values.  
#
# This gauge was established in 1893 for purposes of taxation.

# USA ring sizes.  Several slightly different definitions seem to be in
# circulation.  According to [15], the interior diameter of size n ring in
# inches is 0.32 n + 0.458 for n ranging from 3 to 13.5 by steps of 0.5.  The
# size 2 ring is inconsistently 0.538in and no 2.5 size is listed.  
#
# However, other sources list 0.455 + 0.0326 n and 0.4525 + 0.0324 n as the
# diameter and list no special case for size 2.  (Or alternatively they are
# 1.43 + .102 n and 1.4216+.1018 n for measuring circumference in inches.)  One
# reference claimed that the original system was that each size was 1|10 inch
# circumference, but that source doesn't have an explanation for the modern
# system which is somewhat different.
#
# This table gives circumferences as listed in [15].

# Old practice in the UK measured rings using the "Wheatsheaf gauge" with sizes
# specified alphabetically and based on the ring inside diameter in steps of
# 1|64 inch.  This system was replaced in 1987 by British Standard 6820 which
# specifies sizes based on circumference.  Each size is 1.25 mm different from
# the preceding size.  The baseline is size C which is 40 mm circumference.
# The new sizes are close to the old ones.  Sometimes it's necessary to go
# beyond size Z to Z+1, Z+2, etc.

# Atomic weights.  The atomic weight of an element is the ratio of the mass of
# a mole of the element to 1|12 of a mole of Carbon 12.  The Standard Atomic
# Weights apply to the elements as they occur naturally on earth.  Elements
# which do not occur naturally or which occur with wide isotopic variability do
# not have Standard Atomic Weights.  For these elements, the atomic weight is
# based on the longest lived isotope, as marked in the comments.  In some
# cases, the comment for these entries also gives a number which is an atomic
# weight for a different isotope that may be of more interest than the longest
# lived isotope.
