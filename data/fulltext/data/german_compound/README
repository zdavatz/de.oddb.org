The german dictionaries from OpenOffice.org are missing the compound flags necessary for recognising words that can be compunds of other words.
German language depends heavily on compound words such as "Haustür", which need to be lexized
as "'tür':1 'haus':1 'haustür':1" by tsearch in order to yield 'haustür' when searching for 'tür'.

compound.pl adds the /z Flag to all words that can be contained in other words.
It searches the input dictionary word by word and checks if the given entry is part of another word 
e.g. 'tür' will be found in 'haustür', thus creating the entry tür/z in the dictionary.

Usage:
compound.pl -i german.dic -o german.dict

where german.dic is the original dictionary File from OpenOffice.org and german.dict the compound-extended version.

The resulting file must then be processed by the tool in /my2ispell/ that originally handles the norwegian dictionaries only. You must adjust the Makefile to take the german dictionary + aff-File.
