<p>A major part of the preparations in this group are combined preparations.  Preparations containing e.g. analgesics and antispasmodics could be classified either in this group or in N02 - Analgesics.  Combinations of psycholeptics and antispasmodics could be classified in A03 or in N05 - Psycholeptics etc.  The main indication for the use of the combination will, together with the relative effect of the active components, decide the classification.  In the treatment of pain caused by spasms, the spasmolytic component must be judged as more important than the analgesic component.  Accordingly, analgesic/antispasmodic combinations should be classified in A03 if the main effect of the preparation is the antispasmodic action.  <br>Combined preparations are classified in:<br><br><br>A03C -	Antispasmodics in combination with psycholeptics  <br>A03D -	Antispasmodics in combination with analgesics <br>A03E -	Antispasmodics and anticholinergics in combination with other drugs <br><br>Antispasmodics, which are used specifically in the urogenital tractus, are classified in G04BD - Urinary antispasmodics.  <br><br><table bgcolor="#cccccc" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td>The DDD is equal for different routes of administration (oral, parenteral or rectal) of the same compound and is based on the oral dose. </td></tr></table></p><br>
