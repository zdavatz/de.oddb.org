The following directory also did not exist on my local machine:

	/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/fixes

instead my local machine has the directory

	/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/fixes

but above directory is not on thinpower.

10:00.25.8.2010

There is a difference in the data structure of

	/var/www/de.oddb.org/lib/oddb

between thinpower and the my local machine _*after*_ I done a 
git pull. There must be some files missing that where not added with

	git add

The files that seem to be missing on my local machine are

	business.rb
	text.rb

Trying to setup de.oddb.org results in the following error:

	/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/fixes/singular.rb:4:in `require': no such file to load -- active_support/inflector (LoadError)
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/fixes/singular.rb:4

        from bin/oddbd:9:in `require'
        from bin/oddbd:9

Debugging now.

Short Description: de.oddb.org is an OpenDrugDatabase that enables the
search for Drugs by their ActiveAgent, Name, Producer, ATC-Code and much
more. You can do a price comparison between the Original Drug and the
Generic by Clicking on the Drug's Name. The database tells you a lot
about the officially registerted Drugs in Germany (In Germany any drug
on the market needs to be registered at Bfarm - Bundesinstitut für
Arzneimittel). ODDB.org exports the complete Data in the YAML.org Format
(34117 registred products at the moment).

Background
----------

A discussion on http://www.linuxmednews.org

Post by Zeno: 	In Switzerland we have the problem that there is only
one provider of the data. And that provider serves all hospitals,
doctors, old age homes, pharmacies etc. As they have the monopoly the
could issue a tax on every transaction that is done with there data;
Example: The docotor in the hospital prescribes one drug to the patient.
That info goes into the system and then gets passed on the specialist
(external of hospital) and then gets passed on to the insurance etc.
Imagine you must pay 50cent for every transaction of the data...

Post by Tim: 	This certainly carries some pretty scary scenarios. Are
there not laws to prevent abuse? It would seem that a government
monoploy has been issued here and there would be protections in place.

Post by Zeno: 	1. Yes, that is exactly the problem. The company that
has the monopoly also is working for the government and administrating
the database of all drugs that are covered by the public health
insurance.

		2. I have taken the above issues to antitrust department
and the 'price governing' department of Switzerland. The first pushed
the issue to the second and vice versa. I then contacted the leading
consumer representative of Switzerland and she gave the issue some
momentum.  

		3. The result of the above was ch.oddb.org an independent
database for Switzerland. My personal interest is the acceleration of
the electronic data interchange in the healthcare industry. This can
only take place on open standards.
