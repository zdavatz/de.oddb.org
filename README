Below notes go by timeline. The most uptodate is on top.

08.30 - 30.08.2010

Running

	sudo ./export_fachinfos

results in

	/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/net/smtp.rb:562:in `check_auth_args': both user and secret are required (ArgumentError)
        from /home/zeno/.software/de.oddb.org/lib/oddb/util/smtp_tls.rb:8:in `do_start'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/net/smtp.rb:377:in `start'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/net/smtp.rb:315:in `start'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/util/mail.rb:77:in `sendmail'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/util/mail.rb:27:in `notify_admins'
        from /home/zeno/.software/de.oddb.org/lib/oddb/export/server.rb:73:in `safe_export'
        from /home/zeno/.software/de.oddb.org/lib/oddb/export/server.rb:32:in `export_fachinfo_yaml'
        from ./export_fachinfo_yaml:17
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/util/job.rb:16:in `call'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/util/job.rb:16:in `run'
        from ./export_fachinfo_yaml:16

There must be a configuration somewhere that sets the Mail-sending method. Looking into this now.

08.15 - 30.08.2010

This commit made the difference to start-up de.oddb.org.

	http://scm.ywesee.com/?p=oddb/.git;a=commit;h=d59aaecbf23461cf5c677e3c49d492600909af74

The plain ODDB Library was only setup to work with the new version of
ch.oddb.org. So all the files from 

	/var/www/de.oddb.org/lib/oddb/ 
	
where linked to 

	/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/

But the goal is to install the ODDB-Library seperatly for de.oddb.org
and ch.oddb.org. The config.rb file has also been replaced by the
config.rb from /var/www/de.oddb.org/lib/oddb/ as the .config.rb was
setup for ch.oddb.org - see this commit:

	http://scm.ywesee.com/?p=oddb/.git;a=blobdiff;f=lib/oddb/config.rb;h=280cedcb751c467a58178d5c2eb24efaa2541ab2;hp=35b9efca3430ba8a6e5f83068bba117d40cc381a;hb=8e9cbd2848bd20e18ef158ea520476a183053a34;hpb=70d736e9325049dcb565f995081d65fb6298af3a

11.02 - 26.08.2010

changing

	#    logger.error('fatal') { error }
	        p error

in

	bin/oddbd

and getting the following output

	#<NameError: uninitialized constant ODDB::Util::Server>
	bin/oddbd:18: uninitialized constant ODDB::Util::Server (NameError)

after running

	sudo bin/oddbd

08.06 - 26.08.2010

	bin/exportd

seems to run just fine once I installed

	fastercsv

The version online is 1.4.0. My local version of fastercsv is 1.5.3. My 

	bin/oddbd

crashes right after

	FEHLER:  Relation »target_id_oddb_drugs_atc_code« existiert bereits
	FEHLER:  Relation »target_id_oddb_drugs_sequence_atc« existiert bereits

this is shortly before this message should come (as it does with bin/exportd)

	I, [2010-08-26T08:03:37.025071 #26182]  INFO -- start: starting export-server on druby://localhost:11001

16.23 - 25.08.2010

This file

	/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/encoding/character/utf-8.rb

also needs a

	require 'rubygems'

to get rid of the "Internal Server Error" of Apache. 

I also commened out the following lines 

	#    server = ODDB::Util::Server.new
	#    logger.info('start') {
	#      sprintf("starting oddb-server on %s", url) }
	#    logger.error('fatal') { error }

in

	bin/oddb

that makes de.oddb.org startup but I can not yet search. Apache still delivers some strange errors.

15:30 - 25.08.2010

I am getting on after importing the DB with zcat (same like with oddb.org) I run 

	sudo bin/oddbd

It results in

	FEHLER:  Relation »target_id_oddb_drugs_package_code« existiert bereits

	FEHLER:  Relation »target_id_oddb_drugs_package_substance« existiert bereits

	FEHLER:  Relation »target_id_oddb_drugs_atc_code« existiert bereits

	FEHLER:  Relation »target_id_oddb_drugs_sequence_atc« existiert bereits

	.software/de.oddb.org/bin/oddbd:30: undefined method `error' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)

This looks like de.oddb.org is waiting for a service but I do not know
what kind of service it could be. It may also be just another strange
error.

13:52 - 25.08.2010

I added 		

	require 'rubygems'

to the following files on my local machine

	/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/fixes/singular.rb

In the following file

	/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/model.rb

I changed

	require 'facets/module/basename'

to

	require 'facet/module/basename'

this made the following error go away:

	/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `gem_original_require': no such file to load -- facets/module/basename (LoadError)
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `require'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/model.rb:6
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/drugs/active_agent.rb:4:in `require'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/drugs/active_agent.rb:4
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/drugs.rb:1:in `require'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/drugs.rb:1
        from bin/oddbd:9:in `require'
        from bin/oddbd:9	

Now I am getting

	/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/DBD/Pg/Pg.rb:118:in `initialize': FATAL:  Datenbank >>oddb<< existiert nicht (DBI::OperationalError)
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/DBD/Pg/Pg.rb:62:in `new'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/DBD/Pg/Pg.rb:62:in `connect'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/dbi.rb:424:in `connect'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/dbi.rb:215:in `connect'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/odba/connection_pool.rb:60:in `_connect'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/odba/connection_pool.rb:59:in `times'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/odba/connection_pool.rb:59:in `_connect'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/odba/connection_pool.rb:56:in `connect'
         ... 7 levels...
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/persistence.rb:4
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `gem_original_require'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems/custom_require.rb:31:in `require'
        from bin/oddbd:10
		
I guess I need the DB now.

11:00 - 25.08.2010

The following directory also did not exist on my local machine:

	/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/fixes

instead my local machine has the directory

	/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/fixes

but above directory is not on thinpower.

10:00 - 25.08.2010

There is a difference in the data structure of

	/var/www/de.oddb.org/lib/oddb

between thinpower and the my local machine _*after*_ I done a 
git pull. There must be some files missing that where not added with

	git add

The files that seem to be missing on my local machine are

	business.rb
	text.rb

09:00 - 25.08.2010

Trying to setup de.oddb.org results in the following error:

	/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/fixes/singular.rb:4:in `require': no such file to load -- active_support/inflector (LoadError)
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/fixes/singular.rb:4
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/model.rb:4:in `require'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/model.rb:4
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/drugs/active_agent.rb:4:in `require'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/drugs/active_agent.rb:4
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/drugs.rb:1:in `require'
        from /usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/oddb/drugs.rb:1
        from bin/oddbd:9:in `require'
        from bin/oddbd:9

Debugging now.

Short Description: de.oddb.org is an OpenDrugDatabase that enables the
search for Drugs by their ActiveAgent, Name, Producer, ATC-Code and much
more. You can do a price comparison between the Original Drug and the
Generic by Clicking on the Drug's Name. The database tells you a lot
about the officially registerted Drugs in Germany (In Germany any drug
on the market needs to be registered at Bfarm - Bundesinstitut für
Arzneimittel). ODDB.org exports the complete Data in the YAML.org Format
(34117 registred products at the moment).

Background
----------

A discussion on http://www.linuxmednews.org

Post by Zeno: 	In Switzerland we have the problem that there is only
one provider of the data. And that provider serves all hospitals,
doctors, old age homes, pharmacies etc. As they have the monopoly the
could issue a tax on every transaction that is done with there data;
Example: The docotor in the hospital prescribes one drug to the patient.
That info goes into the system and then gets passed on the specialist
(external of hospital) and then gets passed on to the insurance etc.
Imagine you must pay 50cent for every transaction of the data...

Post by Tim: 	This certainly carries some pretty scary scenarios. Are
there not laws to prevent abuse? It would seem that a government
monoploy has been issued here and there would be protections in place.

Post by Zeno: 	1. Yes, that is exactly the problem. The company that
has the monopoly also is working for the government and administrating
the database of all drugs that are covered by the public health
insurance.

		2. I have taken the above issues to antitrust department
and the 'price governing' department of Switzerland. The first pushed
the issue to the second and vice versa. I then contacted the leading
consumer representative of Switzerland and she gave the issue some
momentum.  

		3. The result of the above was ch.oddb.org an independent
database for Switzerland. My personal interest is the acceleration of
the electronic data interchange in the healthcare industry. This can
only take place on open standards.
